# Welcome to Retro React UI ðŸ“Ÿ

> Relive the nostalgic 90s web experience with our old-school inspired design system - Version v1.1.0

## Installation

Get started by installing Retro React in your project:

<Source dark language="bash" code={`npm install retro-react`} />

## Quick Usage

Easily incorporate our retro components into your project for a vintage look:

<Source
	dark
	language="tsx"
	code={`import React from 'react';
import { Button } from 'retro-react';

function App() {
return <Button>Click me</Button>;
}
`}
/>

- The `pattern` prop is noticeably different in dark mode vs light mode. Explore the components in both modes to see the difference.

### Global styles

Every component in Retro React has a `retro-ui` class name attached to it. This allows you to easily style all components at once. For example, you can change the font family of all components by adding the following CSS to your main stylesheet:

<Source
	dark
	language="css"
	code={`.retro-ui {
	font-family: 'Comic Sans MS', cursive, sans-serif !important;
}`}
/>

### `sx` prop

All components in Retro React support the `sx` prop, which allows you to style components inline without writing CSS. This is powered by [Theme UI](https://theme-ui.com/), which is built on top of [Emotion](https://emotion.sh/docs/introduction).

<Source
	dark
	language="tsx"
	code={`
import { Button } from 'retro-react';

<Button
	sx={{
		backgroundColor: '#ff0080',
		color: 'white',
		fontSize: 4,
	}}
>
	Cool Button
</Button>
`} />

All components have a main **COMPONENT-root** class name attached to them, which allows you to style the root element of a component through CSS or the `sx` prop.
