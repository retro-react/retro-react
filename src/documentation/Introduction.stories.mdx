# Welcome to Retro React UI ðŸ“Ÿ

> Relive the nostalgic 90s web experience with our old-school inspired design system - Version v1.0.7

## Installation

Get started by installing Retro React in your project:

<Source dark language="bash" code={`npm install retro-react`} />

## Quick Usage

Easily incorporate our retro components into your project for a vintage look:

<Source
	dark
	language="tsx"
	code={`import React from 'react';
import { Button } from 'retro-react';

function App() {
return <Button>Click me</Button>;
}
`}
/>

## sx prop

All components in Retro React support the `sx` prop, which allows you to style components inline without writing CSS. This is powered by [Theme UI](https://theme-ui.com/), which is built on top of [Emotion](https://emotion.sh/docs/introduction).

<Source
	dark
	language="tsx"
	code={`
import { Button } from 'retro-react';

<Button
	sx={{
		backgroundColor: 'primary',
		color: 'white',
		fontSize: 4,
	}}
/>
`} />

Take a trip down memory lane and explore our collection of retro-styled components that evoke the charm of the 90s internet. Customize and adapt these components to create a unique experience for your users. Happy coding! ðŸš€
